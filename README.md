# Predicting Crop Production Based on Agricultural Data

## Problem Statement
Agriculture is a key contributor to the economy, and accurately predicting crop production is essential for improving planning and decision-making. This project aims to develop a regression model that forecasts crop production (in tons) based on agricultural factors such as area harvested (in hectares), yield (in kg/ha), and the year, for various crops grown in a specific region.

### Project Overview

## Approach

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handled missing data and standardized column metrics.
- Filtered relevant columns for focused analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Analyze Crop Distribution
- **Crop Types**: Studied the distribution of the `Item` column to identify the most and least cultivated crops across regions.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Explored the `Area` column to understand which regions focus on specific crops or have high agricultural activity.

#### Temporal Analysis
- **Yearly Trends**: Analyzed the `Year` column to detect trends in Area harvested, Yield, and Production over time.
- **Growth Analysis**: Investigated if certain crops or regions showed increasing or decreasing trends in yield or production.

#### Environmental Relationships
- Although explicit environmental data was absent, inferred relationships between Area harvested and Yield to examine the impact of resource utilization on productivity.

#### Input-Output Relationships
- Studied correlations between Area harvested, Yield, and Production to understand the relationship between land usage and productivity.

#### Comparative Analysis
- **Across Crops**: Compared yields (`Yield`) of different crops (`Item`) to identify high-yield vs. low-yield crops.
- **Across Regions**: Compared production (`Production`) across regions (`Area`) to identify highly productive areas.

#### Productivity Analysis
- Examined variations in `Yield` to identify efficient crops and regions.
- Calculated productivity ratios: `Production / Area harvested` to verify and complement yield calculations.

#### Outliers and Anomalies
- Identified anomalies in `Yield` or `Production`, such as unusually high or low values.
- Correlated them with potential external factors like agricultural policies or environmental changes.

### 3. Task: Crop Production Prediction
- **Target Variable**: `Production` (in tons)
- **Use Case**: Predict total output of a specific crop for a given region and year.
  - Answers: *"What will the total production of a specific crop be for a given region and year?"*

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involved creating new insights from existing data to enhance analysis and modeling. 
Key steps included:
- Deriving productivity ratio (`Production / Area harvested`) to measure crop efficiency.
- Aggregating data by region, year, and crop to support meaningful comparisons.
- Preparing categorical fields (`Area`, `Year`, `Item`) for further analysis and modeling.

### Model Development

We developed regression models to predict crop production (in tons) based on year-wise data.

#### Features Used:
- **Input Features** : Year
- **Target Variable**: Production (tons)

#### Modeling Steps:
- Filtered data based on selected crop and region.
- Used `Year` as the input feature to train the model.
- Split data into training and testing sets for offline evaluation.
- Applied the following regression models:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Ridge Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
- Trained models using historical crop production data.
- Deployed a model selection dropdown in the Streamlit UI to let users choose between models.
- Generated future predictions for user-selected years.

#### Notes:
- **Linear Regression**: Best for simple linear trends.
- **Ridge Regression**: Linear model with regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Random Forest**: Captures complex, non-linear patterns and is robust to noise.

### Model Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of each regression model, we used the following metrics:

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
  Measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
  Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. More sensitive to outliers than MAE.

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
  Square root of MSE. Represents error in the same units as the target variable.

- **RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**  
  Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. Ranges from 0 to 1 (higher is better).

### Insights:
- **Random Forest** is expected to perform well in capturing non-linear trends.
- **Ridge Regression** helps prevent overfitting in linear models through regularization.
- **Linear Regression** is best suited for simple linear trends.
